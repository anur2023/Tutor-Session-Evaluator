# 🎓 NLP-Driven Speech Recognition System for Automated Tutoring Session Analysis

## 📌 Problem Statement
In **online one-to-one tutoring platforms**, it is essential that tutors adhere to the organization’s teaching protocols and quality guidelines to ensure consistent student learning outcomes.  

However, manually monitoring and evaluating every session is:  
- ⏳ Time-consuming  
- 💰 Resource-intensive  
- ⚖️ Impractical at scale  

This creates a strong need for an **automated system** that can assess whether tutors are following prescribed guidelines effectively and consistently.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
To address these challenges, we developed an **NLP-driven speech recognition system** that automates session analysis.  

The system works in the following steps:  
1. **Audio Input**: Takes tutoring session recordings (formats such as `.m3u8`, `.mp3`).  
2. **Speech-to-Text**: Converts the speech into text using advanced **speech recognition** techniques.  
3. **NLP Processing**: Applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** methods to analyze the transcribed text and check compliance with organizational guidelines.  
4. **Performance Evaluation**: Generates an **accuracy score** along with a **detailed performance report** for each tutor.  

This enables organizations to monitor tutor performance **efficiently, at scale, and with measurable insights**.
