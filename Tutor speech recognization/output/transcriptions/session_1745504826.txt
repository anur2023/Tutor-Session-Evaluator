 Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, oh and E2 internal resistance is small R1 and R2 are connected in parallel with their terminals are terminals of some polarity connected between together of A and M for the equivalent potential of the Q-sharp gas. So in this particular question we have to tell you that you have to find out the R equation. So we will write E2 is equal to E1 difference E2. We can write this for the R2 resistance. If we want to do more than this, then we will write a formula that both the internal resistance will be in parallel. So to find out the R equivalent resistance, the value of R will be R1 into R2 upon R1 plus R2. In this effective E we have written that E1 difference E2. So in that case we can find out the current value. So I is equal to E1 difference E2 and here we will divide it by multiplying it and then we will write the R1 plus R2. So in this case we will write R1 plus R2 upon R1 plus R2. So this is the fundamental formula that we have written. With this formula you can find out anything. So the resistance is in front of me, I can find out the current value. I have written the fundamental formula. With this particular question you can find out anything. So E1 is equal to E1. So this is the fundamental formula that we have written. So this is the fundamental formula that we have
