So what happens is that the phylogram is equal to the phylogram. So what happens is that the phylogram is equal to the phylogram. So what happens is that the phylogram is equal to the phylogram. So what happens is that the phylogram is equal to the phylogram. So what happens is that the phylogram is equal to the phylogram. So what happens is that the phylogram is equal to the phylogram. So what happens is that the phylogram is equal to the phylogram. So what happens is that the phylogram is equal to the phylogram. So what happens is that the phylogram is equal to the phylogram. So what happens is that the phylogram is equal to the phylogram. So what happens is that the phylogram is equal to the phylogram. So what happens is that the phylogram is equal to the phylogram. So what happens is that the phylogram is equal to the phylogram. So what happens is that the phylogram is equal to the phylogram. So what happens is that the phylogram is equal to the phylogram. So what happens is that the phylogram is equal to the phylogram. So what happens is that the phylogram is equal to the phylogram. So what happens is that the phylogram is equal to the phylogram. So what happens is that the phylogram is equal to the phylogram. So what happens is that the phylogram is equal to the phylogram. So what happens is that the phylogram is equal to the phylogram. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, Oh, Okay. Okay. Seventh question. Question number seven. Seventh one. It says, adding the figure is the hop of our parallelogram. This is also a parallelogram. So find the angle of measure, which is the fact, and find it and use the property to use the property. You can find the angle of measure. So find the  find the angle of measure. So find the angle of measure. So find the angle of measure. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. so this process can be done with some of the triangles and this process can be done here also. You can see this line here. You can also do this here. And there is another doubt. Yes, tell me. This is clear, right? Yes, this is clear. This one has the fifth one. Which one is it? This one has the fifth one. So, it was my book. Okay, I will read it later. Okay, okay. Question number 5. Find the measure of a two-adj angle parallelogram at three ratios. Both have been given. Measure of each angle of the parallelogram. So, what we do is, first of all, we make a parallelogram. Okay? This is our parallelogram. And the ratio is given. So, what we will consider is, the length is, we will consider this as x and this as 2x. Okay? Okay? So, when we consider this as x and this as 2x, then tell me, when we do co-interior angles, the adjoint is, what happens? It is 180, right? This will be our 3x and it is equal to, what will be 180? What is this? You know what this is, right? Co-interior angle. Okay? Yes, I know. Okay. Co-interior angle. Now, what is our x equal to? What will be made? 180 upon 3. This is equal to 60. So, what is x equal to? 60. So, how much is this? 60. And how much is this? 120. Okay? So, now tell me, when this is 70, this will also be 120, right? Yes. This will be 60, right? So, this is my all angle. Okay. Is it clear? Yes, it is clear. Next. Okay. Okay. Question number 3. This has this, right? Yes. Send it back. That is the same question, right? Okay, that is the second question. The one you sent, that is the second question, okay? Yes. Yes. This is talking about how many number of sides is regular point is measure of exterior angle. Okay. This is our exterior angle. So, number of, this is a friend. So, what we do is, number of sides, number of sides, number of sides is equal to, what is it? Our formula is 360 into theta. Okay? So, we have to find this number. Yes, it is the same. I wrote theta, theta, degree degree, right? Either theta or degree, it is the same, right? If we take out sides, then how much will be our 360? Up on 24. Now, write it, it will be out. What will happen, sir? If we do the collision, then 2 well 2, 2 well 3. 15, right? How much is 15? 15. Are you taking it? Yes. And there is the next one, the fourth one. That too. How many sides does regular point is the interior angle? It is 65. Okay, this is called 65. So, this is the interior, okay? So, interior, this is exterior, what is the interior formula?
