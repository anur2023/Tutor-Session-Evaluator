 Hello student, good evening Pritam, welcome to Philo. Pritam, please share your question. Hello Pritam, are you able to hear me? Please share your question. Please show me the question. You have solved it like this, right? 2x-3 is equal to 2, so 2 dt upon dx, so dx is equal to dt upon 2. You have written 10 square x, so you have written x square x minus 1. So, this is not possible from here, right? So, what will be the expression of 1 by dt? Minus t plus? Yes, minus t will be the expression of dt. Minus sign is written on the outside, minus sign is written on the inside. And the expression of dt will be integration t. Sir, this is the problem. The integration of the square written here is 10t, not 10 square t. You have done this wrong, square is not written here. Now, you will do it. Now, I have a doubt. If we want to put the value of t there, then we have to put the value of t here as well. Yes, definitely. Because we have actually selected the value of t. We have to put the value of this t as well as this t. Sir, the answer has not given us such a doubt. So, I will put this and see. So, when we put, it will come. It is equal to 1 upon 2, from here it will come 10. And here I write 2x minus 3 in place of t. 2x minus 3. Okay. We put minus sign. We will write 2x minus 3 in place of t. Okay. Here it will remain 1 upon 2, 10, 2x minus 3. We put minus sign. This will be 2x multiplied. So, minus 2x plus 3. And in the entry case, we know that we put c at the end. Now, what happens is that 1 upon 2, here it is 10. 2x minus 3 minus 2x. Both these are constants. So, by combining these, we put a single constant c. So, the answer must have been given. Please send the answer. Okay, means 2 has been common. Actually, 2x should be there. x should not be there. I will check again. The rest should be x. 2x should be there. I will check again. So, 2x minus 3 is equal to t. We put t. Here, 2 will remain. dt upon dx. dx is equal to dt upon 2. Okay. Here, you have taken 1 upon 2 out. 10 square x is equal to... Oh, yes. You have missed one more thing. When you took 1 upon 2 out. Okay. 10 was with these two. Okay. Now, what did you do here? You multiplied 1 upon 2 with this. And you did not do it with this. If you see in separating. Oh. So, 1 upon 2 will come with this. Okay. So, 1 upon 2 will come here. And here 1 upon 2. So, 2 to 2 will cancel. Then, x will remain. You made a mistake in writing here. When will you write x plus 3? Okay. Okay. Here, we will write 1 upon 2. Here, it will be 10. 2x minus 3. Minus 2x. 3 and c. Both are constant numbers. Okay. 3 is also constant. And c is also constant. So, if we add the same constant number. Then, we will get constant. So, we have written here. That is why, if we add 3 and c. Then, we will get constant. That is why, c is written here. Okay. 2x will be 2. 2 divided by 2. Okay. Okay.
