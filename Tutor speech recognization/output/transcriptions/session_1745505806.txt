 Good afternoon, welcome to Philo. Please share your question. Good afternoon. Please share your question. Yes. You have sent me the question number one, I think, and the question is, in this question, there is a given a data menu. Yes. We have answered it. We have given its solution. We will see. We will see.

Our Mixed you use you use Is the first one is correct, so 0, minus lambda, 0. And the second one is not updating, so it will be 1, x plus lambda, x. Now tell me what will happen in the last one, this will be 0. Minus lambda. And here your plus will remain. And here your plus x will remain. Plus x will remain, plus lambda will remain. Plus lambda. Yes, plus lambda will remain. So here we take the first one according to this, so it will be minus 1. So this will be finished and this will be finished. So minus lambda will remain, 0, minus lambda, lambda. So this one will be 0, lambda square minus, outside is minus, plus lambda square will be given. So this one will be 1, minus lambda square minus, plus lambda square will be given. And the one you have taken as common, tell me. Sir, this one, 0, 1 and 0 cancel? Yes, of course, I don't understand. Yes, the one in front of this is 2, and the one in the column will not be included. So why do I compute the rest of the machine if I consider it to be 1? To solve the determinant? I don't understand. I will write the determinant. We had determinant, I will write the determinant. We have 0, minus lambda, 0. Here you had 1, x plus lambda, x. Here it is 0, minus lambda, lambda. So this much was clear to you. Now what we have to do is, we have to solve according to this column, we have to solve according to this column. So first what will come? If you have to solve, then how do you do it? First you will write 0, you will write the determinant. Now the one in front of this does not come and the one below does not come. If you write 0, which one will come? x plus lambda, x, minus lambda, lambda. How much did you understand? I don't understand. If you solve this, then what do you do? You tell me, what do you solve? Whatever methodology you use, what do you do according to it? How do you solve this? Sir, I don't see anything common. I will tell you the method. Whenever the determinant is given in this way, 3 x 3, then I think you have the main problem in the method. Okay, understand what you do. I will teach you how to solve this. So first of all we have two ways. First is in respect of row and the second is in respect of column. Either we open it in respect of row or we open it in respect of column. I will suggest you to open it in respect of where you get more zeros. If I open it in respect of R1, then we have two zeros in R1. And if I open it in respect of C1, then C1 also has two zeros. So you can either start with R1 or start with C1. You can start with anyone. Now we are taking it from the row. We can also take it from the column. The rule is to keep the first letter out. A 2 x 2 determinant is formed. How does it form? The line in front of the element that we take will not come and the line below it will not come. If I take 0, then nothing will come in front of 0 and nothing below 0. It is clear. I think you have a lot of doubts because you have answered the question. You know it. So it is a bit of a mistake. Are you clear? Yes. Do you have any other questions? No sir. Thank you. Okay.
