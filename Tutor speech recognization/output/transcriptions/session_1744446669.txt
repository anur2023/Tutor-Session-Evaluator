 Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Sir Sir magnetic mood. manager leather hello. manager layer hello. manager layer hello. Sir, there is a lot of confusion. Please clear my confusion. Ok, I will try to understand. Look, remember only one rule, not two or three. It is the right hand palm rule. Ok, sir, what about the other rules? The other rules are, one is the complete mechanism of MIEC. Ok, sir, will it be done with this? What will be the thumb? I will tell you two cases, first case. The thumb will be the velocity of charge or the current of the charge. Or the direction of the current. Sir, what did you say? I didn't understand. What will be the direction of the thumb? You have to keep the thumb where the direction of the current is. Ok, sir, I understood. You have to keep the fingers where the magnetic field is. Ok, sir, I understood. And what will be the perpendicular, the palm, the palm, what will it give you? Force. Force direction. Sir, will this rule be done? The whole mechanism of MIEC will be done. One more rule, just see. C to cross and C to clockwise. If there is something circular, then what will we do? C to cross, C to clockwise. Cross means into, means inside. Inside, inside. And this is outside. Ok, sir. If you have a cross, means clockwise current, if you flow it, magnetic field, inside. C to clock, C to cross. If you do one thing, the other will be done. Ok. You can do this with these two rules. Ok, sir. I will give you, I will give you, try it. Yes, sir. Come on, tell me in P point and Q point. Sir, there will be a cross inside. Sir, this is an easy magnetic field. You have to ask for force. Do one thing, magnetic field is like this. Ok. You have moved the charge like this. Tell me the direction of force. IJ cap. If this is your X, this is Y, this is Z. And this is your Z. So tell me, where will it be? Apply the rule. Sir, which rule will be applied to this? This is the one with the small handle. Ok. So, the charge is going down. And, means, you have to take out the force. Sir, the inside, inside, inward, inward. Let's see. So, your handle is in this. And the velocity is down. How is the inside? So, your is in this. And this is down. See how it is outside. Look at my hand. Can you see my hand? Can you see my hand? Yes, I can see it. So, this is your right hand. This finger is magnetic field. Where is your magnetic field? Here it is. How do I hold it? Ok, you are right. My hand is turning the other way. Where is your magnetic field? Here it is. Here is the magnetic field. And, this is your thumb. Thumb means the velocity of the current. So, the charge is going down. Yes, the charge is going down. And the magnetic field is inside. See, the force is here. The force is here. It is outside. It is outside. Magnetic field is here. Current is here. Magnetic field is here. Current is here. Magnetic field is in charge direction. Sir. Hello. Hello. Hello. Tell me. Sir, velocity is down and current is also down. This is your hand. The charge is in the velocity direction and current is in the current direction. Yes, I understood. It is down. I am holding my thumb. And magnetic field is in this direction. Yes, sir. It is coming out. It is coming out. I told you that it will come out from your practice. Okay, sir. Anything else? No, sir. Now, please ask this question. Let me ask this question. See, what is being said in the question. Let's see. In the question, you have to tell the direction of induced current. Now, what is being said in the question. What is being said is, whatever is happening, you have to stop it. It means, if flux is changing, it doesn't have to happen. If it is increasing, reduce it so that there is no change. If it is increasing, reduce it. If it is decreasing, increase it. Do it in such a way that whatever is happening, you have to stop it. That's all. Now, this is the magnetic field. When you bring the magnetic field near here, magnetic field lines will come out. It will connect with its solenoid. That means, flux will increase. What do you do that the magnetic field stops? If you make it south in front of south, will it stop? Yes, sir. Now, this is for this. But what is there to see for this? It will say that now it is going far, it will go far, then the flux will change. Then it will say, don't go. So, if you make it south for this, it will attract and stop. That means, for both, it is south. But if you see, see from where? See, south means your clockwise current. What happens? Clockwise. Now, to make it clockwise, if you are seeing from here, take it clockwise. See, if you flow the current from here. See, is it clockwise? Because, it didn't tell you where to see. See, it is coming from the solenoid. See, it is coming like this. It is coming from the bottom. Why is it coming from the bottom? Where did it go? It must have gone from the top. So, is it clockwise? Sir, I didn't understand this. You will have to visualize this. You will have to understand this. Now, what happens? It is in the solenoid. It is like a ring. It didn't tell you. You are seeing from the point of view. Okay, sir. Try it. See, it is coming like this. It will come down when the current goes from here. Sir, why did you consider the direction like this? Why? What does south mean? Clockwise. Clockwise means where you have to slow the current. Like this. Means, like this, like this, like this. Now, it is clockwise from here. If you see from here clockwise. Then, how will you see? From the top. But, we can't see from anywhere. So, we will see from here. If you see clockwise from here. Is DC coming? Yes, DC is coming. And then, if one is clockwise. If this is for the other, then it will be NTE. So, two cannot be the same. If A is also there. If DC is there, then the other one will not be BA. It will be AB. See here, BA and DC. See here, BA and DC. See here, BA and DC. This is the question that was controversial. Why? Because, it was not told to you. Whenever you ask, it is told that where do you see from? Nobody told you where you see from. Sir, this is the newspaper of IIT. Yes, I know. I also gave it. It is from 2024. Yes, it is from 2024. Yes, this question was taken from IIT. This is the question. So, try it. Okay.
