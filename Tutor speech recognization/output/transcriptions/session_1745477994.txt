 Hello, will it be for jadvance? Hello, will it be for jadvance? Yes. I'm sending a question. Please explain me that solution. Okay. The image is loading. Hello. Hello. Yeah. I sent a message. Okay, let me see. Okay, let me start. Okay. See. What they did. Firstly, it is given that it is at high two, two meter. Okay. So they used the equation of motion in vertical form s equal to u2 plus s equal to 1. Okay. Here we get the distance two and u equal to, u equal to seven like it is given a 14 meter per cent. And you stay nothing is visible. Is it visible now? Yeah. So it is given two equal to u is given 14. So it will be 70 minus half at an angle 30 degree. So if you have an angle of 30 degree. No, my only one doubt I have only one doubt. What? That that they have taken everything with respect to the block right? Yeah. Yeah, but velocity alone they didn't take with respect to the block. Why? With respect to block. We have second equation for first one. No, in top they have written right two equal to 70 minus half 60 square. And that. So they took because s is they take reference of s which is the placement. If they are taking displacement in downward direction so velocity also they are taking downward direction. What I am asking is everything they are taking with respect to the block and why they are not taking velocity with respect to the block I am asking. But at that time of block starts now so if block starts sliding so at that time the velocity of block is zero. The velocity will be zero at the time it starts sliding. Block started to slide at time t equal to zero right? Yeah. So if block starts sliding so at that time the velocity of block will be zero meter per second. When will it be zero? What are you saying? When you are saying it is zero. When block starts sliding. Yeah when block starts sliding then it has a velocity in y direction also right? It has but at the start u will be zero. Yeah when it starts but it is moving right now currently it is moving. See we have equation v equal to u plus 80. It starts moving but at the time of starting it has u equal to zero. So at some moment it has the velocity v which is equal to 80. Understood? Yeah correct. Initially it is zero only. Initially it is zero but it has started moving right? While the ball is moving. Yeah yeah yeah. So we have to take velocity of ball with respect to block only right? But in the equation we have to take the initial velocity. Initial it has zero. Yeah initial coordination. Initial c. The block they have taken the velocity of ball that is 2 equal to 70 that is half 14 by 2. That is 14 by 2 is u sine theta. Yeah that is why u sine theta they have taken right? But we have to take with respect to the block right? They did not take with respect to the ground. U sine theta with u sine theta. But they have taken with respect to the inclination. Block is also on the inclination. What? They have taken the velocity in context to inclination. Block is also on the inclination and the particle which is projected has also been on the inclined plane. They both are on the inclined plane. When they are taken u sine theta. I got the concept. Sir along the velocity of block is along the inclined. There is no component of velocity along perpendicular to plane. So that only the related velocity is 14 only. They have taken related velocity only. Yeah. Okay I understood. Okay. Thank you. But they did not take horizontal velocity along the horizontal distance. Why? No there is no context of taking horizontal. They have taken. Sir I have got the concept of the horizontal velocity. Okay sir. One more. One more. One more. Okay. Okay. Okay. What is this out? They have taken the frame of the wedge and they did not consider pseudo acceleration. Why? Let me repeat. Let's go to the right of the cubical box of sideways along the left side of the box. But being relative to the box setting and the time after which the block will fit the box. What are you saying? Why they did not consider pseudo acceleration? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, they haven't take because they are seeing in the frame of reference only not in the frame of inclined plane. They are seeing from frame of inclined plane only. So, if they are seeing from plane of inclined plane then they have to take pseudo-photos. They didn't take, why? Then there is the issue with the solution. then there is the issue with the solution if they are seeing in the reference of implant then they don't need to take it.
